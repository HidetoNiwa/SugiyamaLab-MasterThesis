    A sphere falling in a pseudo-plastic fluid was irradiated with ultrasonic waves to investigate the factor of high speed. The falling speed was measured from images. The pressure was measured using a hydrophone. PAA solution was used as the test solution. Viscosity was measured using a viscometer according to the power-law model. The elastic modulus was measured using a rheometer. Experiments were conducted using the following parameters: fluid properties, density of the falling sphere, and diameter. We confirmed that the speed-up by ultrasonic irradiation can be defined by viscosity and acoustic boundary layer thickness. The effect of elasticity as well as viscosity was also examined. It is suggested that the speed-up due to ultrasonic irradiation is caused by viscosity, but the speed-up is suppressed by elasticity.
