    A sphere falling in a pseudo-plastic fluid was irradiated with ultrasonic waves to investigate factors enhancing falling speed. The speed was determined using time-series images. The pressure was measured using a hydrophone. PAA solution was used as the test medium. The non-Newtonian fluid was assumed to involve the power-law viscosity and the elasticity, and its rheology was identified using a viscometer and a rheometer. Experiments were conducted with parameterizing the fluid properties, and the density and diameter of the sphere. We confirmed that the speed-up by ultrasonic irradiation is related to the shear-thinning viscosity, and the acoustic boundary layer thickness. The effects of elasticity as well as viscosity were also examined. The results suggest that the speed-up is suppressed by elastic nature.
